Hotel Booking API
Hotel BookingAPI is the main hotel API in the Hotelbeds API ecosystem. It covers the complete booking process; it is designed to book hotels in real-time as fast as in two steps and allows to generate lists of hotels, confirm bookings, get lists of bookings, manage cancellations & modifications and obtain booking information.


Hotel Booking API works in combination with Hotel ContentAPI to obtain content information from the hotels, such as pictures, descriptions, facilities, services, etc. Please refer to the Hotel ContentAPI documentation and specification for related information.


Hotel Booking API methods
Hotel Booking API uses three different methods to manage booking functions: Hotels, CheckRates, and Bookings.

Hotel BookingAPI has been designed for a two steps confirmation, but due to the complexity of client and provider systems, a third method has been designed.


/hotels

This method is used to request room availability. Some filters and special features can be applied before sending an availability request.

A flexible date search allows customers to retrieve available rates for a specified number of days prior to and post check-in.

The response generated is a list of hotels with the different room types, board types, and rates available for those hotels; but not only restricted to the dates selected.

BookingAPI prices are final. Our rates include supplements and discounts and no additional price calculations are required.

It can also return cancellation fees in the availability response, providing amounts and dates at the first step of the booking.


/checkrates

Most of our hotels are bookable in two steps; however, there are some of them that require obtaining up-to-date availability and prices.

These hotels have the value ƒ?orecheckƒ?? in attribute rateType; and the checkrates method returns up-to-date availability and prices.

This method also returns upselling options and rates (when available). A tag displays the difference of the requested rate versus the upselling rates provided.


/bookings

This method can be used for five different purposes:

Confirm a booking
Get a list of bookings
Get the details of a particular booking
Modify a booking
Cancel a booking or simulate a cancelation to get the details of cancellation conditions.

Overview
With APItude it's simple to book! In order to make a booking, you will need to first search for a list of hotels (Availability Request). Then pick one "rateKey" from the results and then book it (Booking Request). That's it!
Some of our Ratekeys have a "RECHECK" tag, for those ones you will need to make an intermediary operation called CheckRate Request which re-evaluates the pricing and availability of this rate. Look at the example below in order to understand the full APItude booking process.

Searching for a hotel rate
Here is an example of how to request availability for a hotel (3424 and 168 are hotel codes of Hotelbeds - for the purposes of this example, we assume that have already used Content API to map the hotelbeds codes against your system) for 2 adults and 1 child, for the check-in date of 15th June 2020 and for 1 night.

{
    "stay": {
        "checkIn": "2021-06-15",
        "checkOut": "2021-06-16"
    },
    "occupancies": [
        {
            "rooms": 1,
            "adults": 2,
            "children": 0
        }
    ],
    "hotels": {
        "hotel": [
            3424,
            168
        ]
    }
}
You may view more details on how to form an Availability request (including more examples) inside our API Reference documentation.

Parsing the results
An Availability Request will return you all the available rates (i.e. "RateKeys") for the hotels you searched for those dates.

                                ],

                            }
                        ]
                    },

                ],
                "minRate": "130.13",
                "maxRate": "214.38",

        "checkIn": "2020-06-15",
        "total": 1,
        "checkOut": "2020-06-16"
    }
}
In this case, the API returned availability for 2 available rates from the 1 of the 2 hotels that we searched for (3424, hotel "As Americas"). We will try to book the first rate with rateKey 20210615|20210616|W|59|3424|DBL.ST|ID_B2B_26|BB||1~2~0||N@05~~2608a~-321744190~N~~~C7AA6D2F0EC744F159074087674900AAUS0000002000000000721b76. The rateKey is the unique identifier for any rate returned and it has 2 possible rateTypes associated with it, RECHECK or BOOKABLE. If the type is RECHECK you will need to perform an extra operation called CheckRate that will return to you the updated information of that specific rate and then book it, but if the type is BOOKABLE you can immediately book it (no need for CheckRate, the rate information is already updated).

As this specific ratekey is of type RECHECK we will perform a CheckRate operation:

curl --location --request POST 'https://api.test.hotelbeds.com/hotel-api/1.0/checkrates' \
--header 'Api-key: yourApiKeyGoesHere' \
--header 'X-Signature: yourCalculatedXSignatureGoesHere' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Accept-Encoding: gzip' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "rooms": [
        {
            "rateKey": "20210615|20210616|W|59|3424|DBL.ST|ID_B2B_26|BB||1~2~0||N@05~~2608a~-321744190~N~~~C7AA6D2F0EC744F159074087674900AAUS0000002000000000721b76"
        }
    ]
}'
Parsing the results, your will notice that your rateKey's rateType in the results is now type BOOKABLE! Which means you can go book it! So launch your booking operation

curl --location --request POST 'https://api.test.hotelbeds.com/hotel-api/1.0/bookings' \
--header 'Api-key: xxxxxxx' \
--header 'X-Signature: yyyyyyyy' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \

Ratecomments and checkrate usage
When receiving an availabilityRS, you'll find some rates contain a tag named "rateCommentsId". This is important information given on the AvailabilityRS about the rate.

You can retrieve the ratecommentid description using ratecommentdetails operation from content-api. More information here


Below you'll find an example:

<rate
        rateKey = "20201205|20201207|W|256|217516|DBL.DX|GC-ALL|RO||1~2~1|6|N@05~~20c65~107727977~N~~~C8707DE2DC8C4F4159912750444500AAUK0200059001000021020c65"
        rateClass = "NOR"
        rateType = "BOOKABLE"
        net = "101.12"
        allotment = "37"
        rateCommentsId = "256|24524|3"
        paymentType = "AT_WEB"
        packaging = "false"
        boardCode = "RO"
        boardName = "ROOM ONLY"
        rooms = "1"
        adults = "2"
        children = "1"
        childrenAges = "6">
        <cancellationPolicies>
                <cancellationPolicy amount = "75.54" from = "2020-12-02T23:59:00-08:00"/>
        </cancellationPolicies>
</rate>
<rateComments>
        <rateComment dateEnd = "2023-12-31" dateStart = "2015-12-15">
                <description>
                        ***POOL CLOSURE UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE***
                        A valid government issued ID and credit card  deposit is required to check-in and secure any incidental charges.Parking is available at an additional fee, payable locally.
                </description>
        </rateComment>
</rateComments>
However, when retrieving CheckrateRS you'll get a tag "rateComments" that contains more information than the one contained on the content-api.

This behaviour is due to the rateComments delivered on CheckrateRS are build by concatenating different strings. The main ones and how to recover them are:

Issues
Those can be retrieved from content-api using hotels or hoteldetails operations under <issues> tag. More info here
Some facilities
Those can be retrieved from content-api using hotels or hoteldetails operations under <facilities> tag and are identified using the value true on "voucher" tag. More info here
Contract comments (those are the rateComments that you can see in the availability step)
Those can retrieve the ratecommentid description using ratecommentdetails operation from content-api. More information here
Disclaimer: There's a few more items that might be on the ratecomment description on Checkrate depending on the hotel/contract set-up.

Below you'll find examples:

<rate
        rateKey = "20201205|20201207|W|256|217516|DBL.DX|GC-ALL|RO||1~2~1|6|N@05~~20c65~107727977~N~~~C8707DE2DC8C4F4159912750444500AAUK0200059001000021020c65"

Hotel Booking API is designed to book hotels in real time as fast as in two steps. It covers the complete booking process; it allows generating lists of hotels, confirming bookings, getting lists of bookings, obtaining booking information, making cancellations and modify existing bookings.

Hotel Booking API works in combination with Hotel Content API to obtain content information from the hotels, such as pictures, description, facilities, services, etc. Please refer to the Hotel Content API documentation and IO/DOCS for related information.

Hotel Booking API has been designed for a two steps confirmation, but due the the complexity of client and providers systems a third method has been designed.

Availability
Search hotels and rooms available in a given time period

Hotel availability
This method is used to request room availability. Some filters and special features can be applied before sending an availability request.

A flexible date search allows customers to retrieve available rates for a specified number of days prior to and post check-in.

The response generated is a list of hotels with the different room types, board types, and rates available for those hotels, but not only restricted to the dates selected.

BookingAPI prices are final. Our rates include supplements and discounts and no additional price calculations are required.

It can also return cancellation fees in the availability response, providing amounts and dates at the first step of the booking.

Timeout for this operation is 5 seconds.

CheckRate
Get a detailed and updated breakdown of an hotel room rate

Check rate
CheckRate is an optional operation used to assess and valuate the rate before the actual booking. CheckRate returns the same information as the Availability response for a hotel rate with up-to-date price, along with additional information regarding the rate: rate breakdown, rate comments and upselling options.

The CheckRate method can complement the booking process, as it returns additional information to the availability request. However, when the rateType value is 'RECHECK', the CheckRate method is mandatory.

Besides the details for the rate, CheckRate has the option to also return information of higher rates of the same hotel being checked. This is called Upselling.

Upselling returns additional room options, each with its own rate key, allowing you to upgrade the stay quality in room category and rate plan even after the CheckRate operation has been performed.

Timeout for this operation is 15 seconds.

Booking reconfirmation
The Reconfirmation operation allows to retrieve the reconfirmation numbers (The confirmation number of the Hotel, both for the Hotelbeds product and for that of external suppliers product) of the bookings made by the client when requested in a GET call to our endpoint.

Obtaining this reconfirmation numbers from hoteliers is an asynchronous service: reconfirmation numbers are not available at the time of the booking, and as such they can't be informed at the time of the booking, hence the need for this operation.

The Reconfirmation operation offers a wide variety of filters to help narrowing down reconfirmation number results. Only one filter can be used at the same time. Below the four possible filters you can use:

between two cheking dates
between two reconfirmation dates
list of clientReference ids
list of booking Ids
Reconfirmation Service
Additionally we offer you the capacity to receive the reconfirmation numbers automatically in our reconformation service, designed to automatically send you the reconfirmation information as soon as is available from the hoteliers in two different ways:

Push Service : The messages will be automatically sent in JSON format to an endpoint of your choice.
Email Service: The messages will be automatically sent in an email to an address of your choice.
Contact our support team at apitude@hotelbeds.com to learn more about this features.

Reconfirmation Service
Now APItude offers a reconfirmation service for bookings. The Reconfirmation service is designed to provide our clients with the reconfirmation numbers (The confirmation number of the Hotel, both for the Hotelbeds product and for that of external suppliers product) of the bookings made by the clients.

Obtaining this reconfirmation numbers from hoteliers is an asynchronous process: reconfirmation numbers are not available at the time of the booking, and as such they can't be informed at the time of the booking, hence the need for this service to send the numbers as soon as they are available. There are two different ways to obtain the reconfirmation numbers:


Push Service: The messages will be automatically sent in JSON format to an endpoint of your choice.
Email Service: The messages will be automatically sent in an email to an address of your choice.

Alternatively, we also offer a REST operation to retrieve them directly with a GET operation.

Please visit the different documentation pages for each option to learn more. You can also contact our support team to obtain more information and configure the different options.


Push Service
Push Service
With this functionality we will provide the client with the capability to receive automatically the reconfirmation numbers (The confirmation number of the Hotel, both for the Hotelbeds product and for that of external suppliers product) of the bookings made by the client in structured JSON messages.


This reconfirmation number (supplierConfirmationCode) will be provided using a call to a "callBackUrl".


The callBackUrl should be provided by the client and will be validated and configured in Hotelbeds side by the corresponding agent.


With this functionality, the client will receive a list with the reconfirmation numbers in the following format (see Push Message section).


The push service workflow will be:


Hotelbeds receives the reconfirmation number.

The new push service receives, completes the info and stores it.

Once the message is ready to be sent, the push service tries to connect to the callback endpoint configured per client and sends the notification with the reconfirmation number (and other data). From here, two scenarios can happen:

If the request we sent returns a 200 OK code, we assume that you have received the message. The message will be marked as delivered and we won't retry to send the reconfirmation.

If the request returns any other code, it is assumed there was a problem and we will try to resend it after a few minutes/hours/days (configurable). We will retry until we receive the 200 or reach the limit of retries (The limit of retries is a configurable parameter).

PushService Message
This is the format of the message that will be sent to the configured callback endpoint. It will be always in JSON format.

Email Service
Email Service
The ReconfirmationEmail provides the client with the capability to automatically receive the reconfirmation number (The confirmation number of the Hotel, both for the Hotelbeds product and for that of external suppliers product) of the bookings made by the client in email messages sent to an email address defined by the client, "clientEmailAdress".


This service will send an email every time a reconfirmation number arrives at the Hotelbeds systems.


The clientEmailAdress should be provided by the client and will be validated and configured in Hotelbeds side by the corresponding agent.


Email sample
Below an example of the email that you will receive:

How to use Content API
To use ContentAPI to its maximum effectiveness we encourage its users to set up a batch process to retrieve the info from them on a periodic basis, and a database on their side to store the retrieved information and be able to use it when needed. The design of the batch and the database is up to you since not all users have the same needs.


ContentAPI calls and examples are included in APItude's Postman collection, so feel free to test the different request operations of the ContentAPI to familiarize yourself with them before starting your integration with ContentAPI.



RUN IN POSTMAN

IMPORTANT NOTE: By no means should the ContentAPI be used to retrieve the static information in real-time. This could result in the blocking of credentials.
First Steps
One of the main objectives when integrating the ContentAPI is to retrieve the information of the hotels. It is a necessity not just to have the hotel code list to request availability by hotel codes, but also to have the static information of the hotels and be able to show it in your booking process when needed. The best way to retrieve such information is to do it with the Hotels operation, which allows retrieving paged results up to 1000 hotels per request.

As the current Hotelbeds accommodation portfolio is comprised of 173000 hotels approximately, for the initial load of the database 173 requests would be needed to get all the information, defining the first and last hotel in each request in the from and to parameters:



https://api.test.hotelbeds.com/hotel-content-api/1.0/hotels?fields=all&language=ENG&from=1&to=1000
https://api.test.hotelbeds.com/hotel-content-api/1.0/hotels?fields=all&language=ENG&from=1001&to=2000
https://api.test.hotelbeds.com/hotel-content-api/1.0/hotels?fields=all&language=ENG&from=2001&to=3000


And so on...

Additionally, to load the database with the rest of operations to have all the descriptions of the different elements returned in the Hotels operation (segments descriptions, facilities descriptions, destinations, ...) the following petitions will be needed in the same way as the Hotels operation request:


Countries 1 request
Destinations 5 requests
Rooms 3 requests
Boards 1 request
Accommodations 1 request
Categories 1 request
Chains 2 requests
Facilities 1 request
Facility Groups 1 request
Issues 1 request
Languages 1 request
Promotions 1 request
Segments 1 request
Images 1 request

The following operations are not considered mandatory, but we encourage its implementation as well:


Currencies 1 request
Terminals 2 requests
RateComments This operation is optional because the information can be obtained with the CheckRate operation of the BookingAPI (if you do it for all rates). If you want to store them (as we recommend) then you would need 100 additional requests.

In all, the total amount of petitions would be: 173 + 21 + 1 (currencies) + 2 (terminals) + 100 (rate comments) = 297 petitions to have the database loaded with the initial information. With the 4 QPS (Queries Per Second) limit that you will have in the Production plan, this means that in 75 seconds you would have sent all the needed petitions to obtain the initial load of your database. (Not taking into account the needed time to process all the responses and load the info in your database).


This would be just the petitions for one language, so you would need (as the descriptions text fields are language dependant) to repeat this process for every language you wish to implement. You can check which ones are accepted in APItude via the Languages operation.


Subsequent uses
Once you have the initial load you would only have to do one request (we recommend on a daily basis) using the parameter lastUpdateTime to get the differential changes and updates in our static information. For example:


https://api.test.hotelbeds.com/hotel-content-api/1.0/hotels?fields=all&language=ENGCAS&from=1&to=1000&lastUpdateTime=2016-12-16


In this way, you would receive only what has been updated since the date you indicate if you do it daily and we have an average of 3000 hotels updated you would only need 3 petitions to have all the updated hotels.

APItude Hotel Content API
Hotel Content API has been designed to retrieve all the details of the hotels available in our Hotel Booking API.

Hotel Content API contains several methods that allow you to obtain the details of the hotels as well as list of destinations, countries and the master types that complement the hotels informatoin (like room type descriptions, accommodation type descriptions, categories descriptions...).

Note that the Languages operation is connected to all the operations in which a description is returned, since we return the language code in which that description has been returned.

Hotels

Destinations
Return the list of available destinations, zones and grouping zones.

Destinations are the highest level entities in our destination tree by which availability can be searched. Please note that destination codes are not IATA codes. It is very important to understand that our 'destination' will not always only correspond with a unique city, but usually with the main city and the area surrounding the city.

For example, the destination code NYC in the US, corresponds with the whole New York Area, so it is not limited to the city of New York, but also covers the surrounding areas, such as New Jersey and The Hamptons. Another example is BCN in Spain, which corresponds with the entire Barcelona Province; so it searches hotels located in the city of Barcelona, but also in other cities within the Province of Barcelona, such us Hospitalet de Llobregat, Terrassa and Sabadell. So when you search for availability using the destination code, you will receive results that may be located far from the main city for which you are actually searching.

It is very important to check the locations that the search retrieves to avoid booking hotels in a different location than the one requested by your customers.

Use of Rate Comments
Rate comments, also called contract comments or contract remarks, are important information that the traveler should know when they book a hotel.

Some examples of rate comments are:

Minimum age of registration 21 Years Old
The Key for the apartment needs to be collected at 522 Main Street.
This information could be related to hotel operational but also to rate limitations or hotel rules. For this reason, it is important to show this information during the booking process.

Rate comments are sent on each booking operation, it is Availability, CheckRate, Confirmation and even Booking details operation. However, in the first, the information is represented differently.

1 - Rate comments at Availability
Next, an example of how rate comments look like at Availability response. Pay attention to the field rateCommentsId , which returns the code: 256|24524|3

These are the steps that you have to follow to build the rate comments at this step:

1.1 - Use this code to retrieve the initial rate comment from Content API.
You have two ways to do it:

Offline solution (recommended): Use the ƒ?orateCommentsƒ?? operation
This operation retrieves all rate comments from all hotels. Next an example of how it shows one rate-comments with this operation.
[...]
<rateComment incoming="102" hotel="14978" code="173049">
      <commentsByRates>
        <commentByRates rateCodes="2 0">
          <comments dateEnd="2022-12-31" dateStart="2014-10-24">
            <description>First child until 12 years old free in room only basis, sharing room with their parents, on request.
Cot from 0-2 years old free, on request</description>
          </comments>
        </commentByRates>
      </commentsByRates>
    </rateComment>
[...]

You must match the code from the Availability operation from those returned (and stored locally) by this operation. You can do that knowing that: rateCommentsId = incoming | code | rateCodes

You must also have into account the dateStart and dateEnd dates, based on the check-in date. For example, for the same code we could have:


startDate	endDate	Description
1st May 2016	1st Sep 2016	"Minimum age of registration 19"
1st May 2016	1st Sep 2016	"Minimum age of registration 21"
2nd Sep 2016	1st Dec 2016	"Minimum age of registration 21"

If the check-in is 13th October 2016 then the rateComment to choose is "Minimum age of registration 21".

If you find more than one description applicable to the check-in date, you would have to concatenate each of them and show it to the final passenger.


Online solution: Use the ƒ?orateCommentDetailsƒ?? operation.
This operation uses the rate-comments code and the check-in date of the availability request to return the rate-comments description. Check for more information here.

1.2. Retrieve the Taxes information.
Those can be retrieved from availability response, after the development of the tax breakdown, more information could be found here here


1.3. Retrieve the Issues of the hotel.
Those can be retrieved from content-API using hotels or hoteldetails operations under <issues> tag. More info here.


1.4. Retrieve the mandatory facilities.
Those can be retrieved from content-API using hotels or hoteldetails operations under <facilities> tag and are identified using the value true on the "voucher" tag. More info here.


1.5. Concatenate all the information you retrieved from steps 1 to 4.
You have the full rate comments now!


2 - Rate comments at CheckRates, Booking and BookingDetail
Except for the Availability, the rest of operations will directly return the full rate comments for you, that is, the concatenation previously explained is already done.

Here you have for example a sample of the CheckRates. Pay attention to the field: rateComments

Use of images
The images of the hotels provided by Hotelbeds in the /hotels and /hoteldetails operations are available in 7 different sizes, but they are not returned with their full path, just the final part of the path and the name of the image file.

In order to get the images in their different sizes for your system to show them to the clients you will need to add the image path retrieved from said operations to the following base URL for the different sized images:


https://photos.hotelbeds.com/giata/

The different paths for the different sizes are:


https://photos.hotelbeds.com/giata/ + {path} For 320 pixel-wide images (standard size)
https://photos.hotelbeds.com/giata/small/ + {path} For 74 pixel-wide images (thumbnail size)
https://photos.hotelbeds.com/giata/medium/ + {path} For 117 pixel-wide images
https://photos.hotelbeds.com/giata/bigger/ + {path} For 800 pixel-wide images
https://photos.hotelbeds.com/giata/xl/ + {path} For 1024 pixel-wide images
https://photos.hotelbeds.com/giata/xxl/ + {path} For 2048 pixel-wide images
https://photos.hotelbeds.com/giata/original/ + {path} For images in its original size (please note that this is not a standard and actual size may vary between hotels)

Example:
https://photos.hotelbeds.com/giata/00/004200/004200a_hb_ro_006.jpg


Please note that some hotels may not have available XL and XXL sized images.
When the requested image size is not available we will receive the following error:

Error: 403Forbidden
RS:
<Error>
  <Code>AccessDenied</Code>
  <Message>Access Denied</Message>
</Error>
