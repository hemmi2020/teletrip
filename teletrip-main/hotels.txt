Getting Started with API Suite
There are three simple steps before starting development with API Suite: register to get your API Key and Secret, configure your Authentication and begin testing.
1. Register for an API Key
Register today with our extremely simple registration process to get an ID and API Keys for our three API suites and gain access to our evaluation environment! In only a few clicks you will be able to get your API Key for testing purposes. The API key is required to launch every request of our API.


step_1

2. Find your credentials & configure your authentication
Once registered you will already have all you need to do your first request to our APIs, as you will be provided of a set of three API Keys, one for each of our API suites: Hotel, Activities, and Transfers. Check them at your personal dashboard.


step_2

To authenticate, you must send both the API Key and the X-Signature, a SHA256 hash in Hex format calculated from your API key, your secret plus current timestamps in seconds:

#!/bin/bash 
apiKey="yourApiKey"
secret="yourSecret"
curl -i \
-X GET \
-H 'Accept:application/json' \
-H 'Api-key:'$apiKey'' \
-H 'X-Signature:'$(echo -n ${apiKey}${secret}$(date +%s)|sha256sum|awk '{ print $1}')'' \
https://api.test.hotelbeds.com/hotel-api/1.0/status

3. Begin testing your requests
Once you have received your credentials and have configured your authentication, you can start making requests against our test endpoint, https://api.test.hotelbeds.com. The servers behind this endpoint are identical to our production servers, but any booking requests made against them will not result in actual property reservations or credit card charges, so you can test all you want. For your first request you can use our Swagger specification or our postman collections:

BookingAPI
ContentAPI
When using Postman, remember that you will need to edit the environment and change the {{Api-key}} and {{secret}} variable values with your API key and Secret. Our Postman collection features a script that calculates the X-Signature, so you don't need to worry for this.


NOTE: Please note that the API keys provided with registration will only give you access to our evaluation environment, with a limited allowed quota of 50 requests per day. If the quota is exceeded you will receive a 403 error. To improve the quota we suggest to progress through your profile progression section in your personal dashboard to upgrade to our certification environment for better quotas.

Hotel Booking API
Hotel BookingAPI is the main hotel API in the Hotelbeds API ecosystem. It covers the complete booking process; it is designed to book hotels in real-time as fast as in two steps and allows to generate lists of hotels, confirm bookings, get lists of bookings, manage cancellations & modifications and obtain booking information.


Hotel Booking API works in combination with Hotel ContentAPI to obtain content information from the hotels, such as pictures, descriptions, facilities, services, etc. Please refer to the Hotel ContentAPI documentation and specification for related information.


Hotel Booking API methods
Hotel Booking API uses three different methods to manage booking functions: Hotels, CheckRates, and Bookings.

Hotel BookingAPI has been designed for a two steps confirmation, but due to the complexity of client and provider systems, a third method has been designed.


/hotels

This method is used to request room availability. Some filters and special features can be applied before sending an availability request.

A flexible date search allows customers to retrieve available rates for a specified number of days prior to and post check-in.

The response generated is a list of hotels with the different room types, board types, and rates available for those hotels; but not only restricted to the dates selected.

BookingAPI prices are final. Our rates include supplements and discounts and no additional price calculations are required.

It can also return cancellation fees in the availability response, providing amounts and dates at the first step of the booking.


/checkrates

Most of our hotels are bookable in two steps; however, there are some of them that require obtaining up-to-date availability and prices.

These hotels have the value “recheck” in attribute rateType; and the checkrates method returns up-to-date availability and prices.

This method also returns upselling options and rates (when available). A tag displays the difference of the requested rate versus the upselling rates provided.


/bookings

This method can be used for five different purposes:

Confirm a booking
Get a list of bookings
Get the details of a particular booking
Modify a booking
Cancel a booking or simulate a cancelation to get the details of cancellation conditions.


Overview
With APItude it's simple to book! In order to make a booking, you will need to first search for a list of hotels (Availability Request). Then pick one "rateKey" from the results and then book it (Booking Request). That's it!
Some of our Ratekeys have a "RECHECK" tag, for those ones you will need to make an intermediary operation called CheckRate Request which re-evaluates the pricing and availability of this rate. Look at the example below in order to understand the full APItude booking process.

Searching for a hotel rate
Here is an example of how to request availability for a hotel (3424 and 168 are hotel codes of Hotelbeds - for the purposes of this example, we assume that have already used Content API to map the hotelbeds codes against your system) for 2 adults and 1 child, for the check-in date of 15th June 2020 and for 1 night.

{
    "stay": {
        "checkIn": "2021-06-15",
        "checkOut": "2021-06-16"
    },
    "occupancies": [
        {
            "rooms": 1,
            "adults": 2,
            "children": 0
        }
    ],
    "hotels": {
        "hotel": [
            3424,
            168
        ]
    }
}
You may view more details on how to form an Availability request (including more examples) inside our API Reference documentation.

Parsing the results
An Availability Request will return you all the available rates (i.e. "RateKeys") for the hotels you searched for those dates.

                                ],

                        ]

                ],
                "minRate": "130.13",

        "total": 1,
        "checkOut": "2020-06-16"
    }
}
In this case, the API returned availability for 2 available rates from the 1 of the 2 hotels that we searched for (3424, hotel "As Americas"). We will try to book the first rate with rateKey 20210615|20210616|W|59|3424|DBL.ST|ID_B2B_26|BB||1~2~0||N@05~~2608a~-321744190~N~~~C7AA6D2F0EC744F159074087674900AAUS0000002000000000721b76. The rateKey is the unique identifier for any rate returned and it has 2 possible rateTypes associated with it, RECHECK or BOOKABLE. If the type is RECHECK you will need to perform an extra operation called CheckRate that will return to you the updated information of that specific rate and then book it, but if the type is BOOKABLE you can immediately book it (no need for CheckRate, the rate information is already updated).

As this specific ratekey is of type RECHECK we will perform a CheckRate operation:

curl --location --request POST 'https://api.test.hotelbeds.com/hotel-api/1.0/checkrates' \
--header 'Api-key: yourApiKeyGoesHere' \
--header 'X-Signature: yourCalculatedXSignatureGoesHere' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Accept-Encoding: gzip' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "rooms": [
        {
            "rateKey": "20210615|20210616|W|59|3424|DBL.ST|ID_B2B_26|BB||1~2~0||N@05~~2608a~-321744190~N~~~C7AA6D2F0EC744F159074087674900AAUS0000002000000000721b76"
        }
    ]
}'
Parsing the results, your will notice that your rateKey's rateType in the results is now type BOOKABLE! Which means you can go book it! So launch your booking operation

curl --location --request POST 'https://api.test.hotelbeds.com/hotel-api/1.0/bookings' \
--header 'Api-key: xxxxxxx' \
--header 'X-Signature: yyyyyyyy' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Accept-Encoding: gzip' \

Ratecomments and checkrate usage
When receiving an availabilityRS, you'll find some rates contain a tag named "rateCommentsId". This is important information given on the AvailabilityRS about the rate.

You can retrieve the ratecommentid description using ratecommentdetails operation from content-api. More information here


Below you'll find an example:

<rate
        rateKey = "20201205|20201207|W|256|217516|DBL.DX|GC-ALL|RO||1~2~1|6|N@05~~20c65~107727977~N~~~C8707DE2DC8C4F4159912750444500AAUK0200059001000021020c65"

                <cancellationPolicy amount = "75.54" from = "2020-12-02T23:59:00-08:00"/>
        </cancellationPolicies>
</rate>
<rateComments>
        <rateComment dateEnd = "2023-12-31" dateStart = "2015-12-15">
                <description>
                        ***POOL CLOSURE UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE***

                </description>
        </rateComment>
</rateComments>
However, when retrieving CheckrateRS you'll get a tag "rateComments" that contains more information than the one contained on the content-api.

This behaviour is due to the rateComments delivered on CheckrateRS are build by concatenating different strings. The main ones and how to recover them are:

Issues
Those can be retrieved from content-api using hotels or hoteldetails operations under <issues> tag. More info here
Some facilities
Those can be retrieved from content-api using hotels or hoteldetails operations under <facilities> tag and are identified using the value true on "voucher" tag. More info here
Contract comments (those are the rateComments that you can see in the availability step)
Those can retrieve the ratecommentid description using ratecommentdetails operation from content-api. More information here
Disclaimer: There's a few more items that might be on the ratecomment description on Checkrate depending on the hotel/contract set-up.

Below you'll find examples:

APItude Hotel Booking API
Hotel Booking API is designed to book hotels in real time as fast as in two steps. It covers the complete booking process; it allows generating lists of hotels, confirming bookings, getting lists of bookings, obtaining booking information, making cancellations and modify existing bookings.

Hotel Booking API works in combination with Hotel Content API to obtain content information from the hotels, such as pictures, description, facilities, services, etc. Please refer to the Hotel Content API documentation and IO/DOCS for related information.

Hotel Booking API has been designed for a two steps confirmation, but due the the complexity of client and providers systems a third method has been designed.

Availability
Search hotels and rooms available in a given time period

Hotel availability
This method is used to request room availability. Some filters and special features can be applied before sending an availability request.

A flexible date search allows customers to retrieve available rates for a specified number of days prior to and post check-in.

The response generated is a list of hotels with the different room types, board types, and rates available for those hotels, but not only restricted to the dates selected.

BookingAPI prices are final. Our rates include supplements and discounts and no additional price calculations are required.

It can also return cancellation fees in the availability response, providing amounts and dates at the first step of the booking.

Timeout for this operation is 5 seconds.

CheckRate
Get a detailed and updated breakdown of an hotel room rate

Check rate
CheckRate is an optional operation used to assess and valuate the rate before the actual booking. CheckRate returns the same information as the Availability response for a hotel rate with up-to-date price, along with additional information regarding the rate: rate breakdown, rate comments and upselling options.

The CheckRate method can complement the booking process, as it returns additional information to the availability request. However, when the rateType value is 'RECHECK', the CheckRate method is mandatory.

Besides the details for the rate, CheckRate has the option to also return information of higher rates of the same hotel being checked. This is called Upselling.

Upselling returns additional room options, each with its own rate key, allowing you to upgrade the stay quality in room category and rate plan even after the CheckRate operation has been performed.

Timeout for this operation is 15 seconds.

Booking reconfirmation
The Reconfirmation operation allows to retrieve the reconfirmation numbers (The confirmation number of the Hotel, both for the Hotelbeds product and for that of external suppliers product) of the bookings made by the client when requested in a GET call to our endpoint.

Obtaining this reconfirmation numbers from hoteliers is an asynchronous service: reconfirmation numbers are not available at the time of the booking, and as such they can't be informed at the time of the booking, hence the need for this operation.

The Reconfirmation operation offers a wide variety of filters to help narrowing down reconfirmation number results. Only one filter can be used at the same time. Below the four possible filters you can use:

between two cheking dates
between two reconfirmation dates
list of clientReference ids
list of booking Ids
Reconfirmation Service
Additionally we offer you the capacity to receive the reconfirmation numbers automatically in our reconformation service, designed to automatically send you the reconfirmation information as soon as is available from the hoteliers in two different ways:

Push Service : The messages will be automatically sent in JSON format to an endpoint of your choice.
Email Service: The messages will be automatically sent in an email to an address of your choice.
Contact our support team at apitude@hotelbeds.com to learn more about this features.

Reconfirmation Service
Now APItude offers a reconfirmation service for bookings. The Reconfirmation service is designed to provide our clients with the reconfirmation numbers (The confirmation number of the Hotel, both for the Hotelbeds product and for that of external suppliers product) of the bookings made by the clients.

Obtaining this reconfirmation numbers from hoteliers is an asynchronous process: reconfirmation numbers are not available at the time of the booking, and as such they can't be informed at the time of the booking, hence the need for this service to send the numbers as soon as they are available. There are two different ways to obtain the reconfirmation numbers:


Push Service: The messages will be automatically sent in JSON format to an endpoint of your choice.
Email Service: The messages will be automatically sent in an email to an address of your choice.

Alternatively, we also offer a REST operation to retrieve them directly with a GET operation.

Please visit the different documentation pages for each option to learn more. You can also contact our support team to obtain more information and configure the different options.

Push Service
Push Service
With this functionality we will provide the client with the capability to receive automatically the reconfirmation numbers (The confirmation number of the Hotel, both for the Hotelbeds product and for that of external suppliers product) of the bookings made by the client in structured JSON messages.


This reconfirmation number (supplierConfirmationCode) will be provided using a call to a "callBackUrl".


The callBackUrl should be provided by the client and will be validated and configured in Hotelbeds side by the corresponding agent.


With this functionality, the client will receive a list with the reconfirmation numbers in the following format (see Push Message section).


The push service workflow will be:


Hotelbeds receives the reconfirmation number.

The new push service receives, completes the info and stores it.

Once the message is ready to be sent, the push service tries to connect to the callback endpoint configured per client and sends the notification with the reconfirmation number (and other data). From here, two scenarios can happen:

If the request we sent returns a 200 OK code, we assume that you have received the message. The message will be marked as delivered and we won't retry to send the reconfirmation.

If the request returns any other code, it is assumed there was a problem and we will try to resend it after a few minutes/hours/days (configurable). We will retry until we receive the 200 or reach the limit of retries (The limit of retries is a configurable parameter).

PushService Message
This is the format of the message that will be sent to the configured callback endpoint. It will be always in JSON format.

Email Service
Email Service
The ReconfirmationEmail provides the client with the capability to automatically receive the reconfirmation number (The confirmation number of the Hotel, both for the Hotelbeds product and for that of external suppliers product) of the bookings made by the client in email messages sent to an email address defined by the client, "clientEmailAdress".


This service will send an email every time a reconfirmation number arrives at the Hotelbeds systems.


The clientEmailAdress should be provided by the client and will be validated and configured in Hotelbeds side by the corresponding agent.

Booking reconfirmation
The Reconfirmation operation allows to retrieve the reconfirmation numbers (The confirmation number of the Hotel, both for the Hotelbeds product and for that of external suppliers product) of the bookings made by the client when requested in a GET call to our endpoint.

Obtaining this reconfirmation numbers from hoteliers is an asynchronous service: reconfirmation numbers are not available at the time of the booking, and as such they can't be informed at the time of the booking, hence the need for this operation.

The Reconfirmation operation offers a wide variety of filters to help narrowing down reconfirmation number results. Only one filter can be used at the same time. Below the four possible filters you can use:

between two cheking dates
between two reconfirmation dates
list of clientReference ids
list of booking Ids
Reconfirmation Service
Additionally we offer you the capacity to receive the reconfirmation numbers automatically in our reconformation service, designed to automatically send you the reconfirmation information as soon as is available from the hoteliers in two different ways:

Push Service : The messages will be automatically sent in JSON format to an endpoint of your choice.
Email Service: The messages will be automatically sent in an email to an address of your choice.
Contact our support team at apitude@hotelbeds.com to learn more about this features.
