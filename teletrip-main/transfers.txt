Availability Simple Transfers logo icon


Availability is the first operation in the booking flow of APItude, it allows to check which available transfer services can be booked in the requested area for a given range of dates and for a given passengers group.


Remenber API can work with following types codes :


IATA : Airport standard (recommended).
ATLAS : HB custom hotel codes (recommended).
GPS : Latitude and longitude coordinates, A minimun of three decimal places is required to ensure adequate positional accuracy (description and complete address must be indicated during confirmation)
PORT : HB custom port codes
STATION : HB custom stations codes


In case you already have stored the HB Atlas codes you can use them, as they will be the same, if not you must obtain and cache the routes and content (optional) usingTransfers CACHEAPI, as it's designed to return all the static information and routes needed to operate the Transfers BookingAPI as quickly and simple as possible.

Post Booking Operations
Once you have confirmed bookings, there's a series of operations that can be performed:

BookingDetail: To retrieve the information of a specific booking.
BookingCancellation: To cancel a booking.

Post Booking Operations
Once you have confirmed bookings, there's a series of operations that can be performed:

BookingDetail: To retrieve the information of a specific booking.
BookingCancellation: To cancel a booking.
Bear in mind that you will need the booking reference of the bookings you carried out to perform this operation
